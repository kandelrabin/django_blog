            <h2><a href="">Django Basics</a></h2>
            <p>Django is a free, open-source web application framework written in Python, designed to simplify
                website development by providing ready-made components. It handles essential tasks such as user
                authentication, content management, and URL routing. When a server receives a request, Django's
                urlresolver matches the URL to a predefined pattern and directs it to the appropriate view function,
                which processes the request and interacts with the database if necessary. This structure helps
                developers build complex websites more efficiently by reusing common solutions instead of starting
                from scratch.</p>
